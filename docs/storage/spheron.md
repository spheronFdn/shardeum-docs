Overall, Spheron offers a comprehensive solution for building and running decentralized applications in a secure and scalable manner.

## How to deploy static apps on Spheron?

Deploying static apps on Spheron is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to deploy your static apps on Spheron:

1. **Connect your Git Provider:**<br/>
   Connecting your Git provider allows Spheron to sync your repositories and trigger deployments whenever new updates are made. Spheron supports the following Git providers: [Github](https://github.com/), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

2. **Set up your project:**<br/>
   Create a new project on the Spheron and choose your desired app repository for deployment.

3. **Select deployment protocol:**<br/>
   Select your desired protocol for hosting your static app. Spheron supports the following protocols: **Arweave**, **Filecoin**, and **IPFS**.

4. **Configure deployment settings:**<br/>
   Spheron will automatically detect and configure most of these settings for you. You have to [add environment variables](https://docs.spheron.network/static/projects/variables/) in the dedicated section. If needed, modify the remaining parameters according to your requirements. That includes selecting the framework, branch, root directory, build and output settings, and the node engine.

5. **Trigger deployment:**<br/>
   After configuring all the required settings, initiate the deployment process. Spheron will fetch your code, build the static files, and deploy them to your specified protocol.

6. **Access your app:**<br/>
   Once the deployment is complete, you can access your app through the domain generated by Spheron. You also have the option to [set up a custom domain](https://docs.spheron.network/static/projects/domain/) for your app.
