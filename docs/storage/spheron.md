## How to deploy static apps on Spheron?

Deploying static apps on Spheron is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to deploy your static apps on Spheron:

1. **Connect your Git Provider:**<br/>
   Connecting your Git provider allows Spheron to sync your repositories and trigger deployments whenever new updates are made. Spheron supports the following [Git providers](https://docs.spheron.network/static/deployment/logs/): Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket.

2. **Set up your Project:**<br/>
   Create a new project on Spheron and choose your desired app repository for deployment.

3. **Select deployment protocol:**<br/>
   Select your desired protocol for hosting your static app. Spheron supports the following protocols: **Arweave**, **Filecoin**, and **IPFS**.

4. **Configure deployment settings:**<br/>
   Spheron will automatically detect and configure most of these settings for you. You have to [add environment variables](https://docs.spheron.network/static/projects/variables/) in the dedicated section. If needed, modify the remaining parameters according to your requirements. That includes selecting the framework, branch, root directory, build and output settings, and the node engine.

5. **Trigger deployment:**<br/>
   After configuring all the required settings, initiate the deployment process. Spheron will fetch your code, build the static files, and deploy them to your specified protocol.

6. **Access your app:**<br/>
   Once the deployment is complete, you can access your app through the domain generated by Spheron. You also have the option to [set up a custom domain](https://docs.spheron.network/static/projects/domain/) for your app.

## How to upload to IPFS using Spheron SDK?

### 1. Spheron Storage SDK (for Nodejs environments)

### Installation

```sh
npm i @spheron/storage
```

### Usage

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

const client = new SpheronClient({ token });

let currentlyUploaded = 0;

const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await client.upload(
  filePath,
  {
    protocol: ProtocolEnum.IPFS,
    name,
    onUploadInitiated: (uploadId) => {
      console.log(`Upload with id ${uploadId} started...`);
    },
    onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
      currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
      console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
    },
  }
);
```

> Checkout our [Storage SDK Documentation](https://docs.spheron.network/sdk/storage/) for more info.

### 2. Spheron Browser Upload SDK (for Browser environments)

### Installation

```sh
npm i @spheron/browser-upload
```

### Usage

### Server

You have to set up a web server with an endpoint that will be used by the frontend to fetch the token for upload.

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

...

app.get("/initiate-upload", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const bucketName = "example-browser-upload"; // use your preferred name
    const protocol = ProtocolEnum.IPFS; // use your preferred protocol
    const token = process.env.SPHERON_TOKEN; // add your access token in .env or paste it here

    const client = new SpheronClient({ token });

    const { uploadToken } = await client.createSingleUploadToken({
      name: bucketName,
      protocol,
    });

    res.status(200).json({
      uploadToken,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    next(error);
  }
});
```

### Client

You have to send a request to your server to create the uploadToken that will be used to upload files from the browser.

```js
import { upload } from "@spheron/browser-upload";

...

const response = await fetch(`<BACKEND_URL>/initiate-upload`); // get the temporary access token from server
const resJson = await response.json();
const token =  resJson.uploadToken;

let currentlyUploaded = 0;

const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await upload(files, {
  token,
  onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
    currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
    console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
  },
});

...
```

```
sudo npm install -g @spheron/cli
```

#### For Windows

To install the Spheron CLI, open your terminal as administrator mode and run the following command:

```
npm install -g @spheron/cli
```

## Usage

### spheron init

The `spheron init` command allows you to initialize a new Spheron project. A `spheron.json` file is created in your current path that describes your project. It will be utilized by the `spheron publish` command.

#### Usage

```sh
spheron init
```

Upon running this command, a prompter will appear that will allow you to select protocol, add project name, add path, and select framework. Here is how it will look:

```sh
? Project name: (Code)
? Upload protocol: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Arweave
  Filecoin
  IPFS
```

### spheron publish

The `spheron publish` command allows you to upload your project using the configuration that is described in the `spheron.json` file of your project.

#### Usage

```sh
spheron publish
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure that you create a production build before running the `spheron
  publish` command.
</Callout>

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Spheron CLI 1.0.7

2. Append the CID to your gateway URL in the following format:

```
https://{gateway-name}.spheron.link/ipfs/{cid}
```
